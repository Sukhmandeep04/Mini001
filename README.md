__________________________

1. Promises and Async/Await
      readUserData(): Uses Promises and async/await to read user data from 'users.json'.
      writeUserData(userData): Implements Promises and async/await for writing user data to 'users.json'.

2. Callbacks
      handlePostUser(req, res): Highlights where callbacks are still helpful, specifically in handling POST requests where data parsing                                     occurs asynchronously.

3. Event Loop
      Operates seamlessly within the Node.js event loop, ensuring efficient handling of asynchronous operations.

4. Error Handling
      It provides robust error handling for asynchronous operations, including appropriate HTTP status codes and messages for various error       scenarios.

5. Response Handling
      sendJSONResponse(res, status, data): Sends JSON responses with specified status codes.
      sendResponse(res, status, contentType, data): Sends responses based on content type.
      Request Handling Functions
      handleGetUsers(req, res): Asynchronously handles GET requests for user data.
      handlePostUser(req, res): Manages POST requests asynchronously, utilizing callbacks for data parsing.
      handlePutUser(req, res, userId): Asynchronously handles PUT requests, updating user data.
      handleDeleteUser(req, res, userId): Asynchronously handles DELETE requests, deleting user data.

7.HTTP Server
      Creates an HTTP server using async/await to handle various HTTP methods and routes for user data.
